# FitSpark-AI
####An AI-enhanced prototype fitness application built with Python V3.11 (and Streamlit) and developed as part of a Master's dissertation project. This version integrates a reinforcement learning (Q-learning) agent within the Adaptation Engine to personalize workout recommendations. The Q-learning agent is adapted from Gaspar-Figueiredo et al (2024): https://github.com/RESQUELAB/RL-UIAdaptation (full reference below). 

###Features 
- Personalized workout recommendations based on a pre-trained Q-agent. 
- Adaptive User Interface with dynamic content presentation, incorporating user feedback in real time. 
- Event logging for usability testing. 

###Repository Structure
***The application is inspired by the Model-View-Controller design pattern.***
***-Adaptation_Engine:***Contains the RL algorithm, training data, and Jupyter Notebooks used for training/testing the Q-learning agent. 
***-images:***Stores images for the UI. 
***controller.py:***Logic for event logging, image loading, Q-table management and Q-table updates. 
***model_sub_workout_data.py:***Contains the dataset of workouts and associated details. 
***view.py:***Streamlit frontend implementation of the application, including workout display and navigation. 

###Installation & Running
1. After cloning the repository, it is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment 
python -m venv venv
source ven/bin/activate # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

2. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application
streamlit run view.py
